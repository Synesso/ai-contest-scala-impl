todo:
    only send to neutrals when enemy is attacking if you arrive after it hits zero
    send more than worst state if the enemy state keeps regenerating (ie fleet is further away than worst state)
    if there are only zero regen planets left then consider them
    don't send if you can't arrive in time (?)
    simple tie-breaking on best candidate (by planet index)
    favour targets for which you have already committed lots (best target changes as map does)
    [maybe] all left over surplus should head towards target # 1.

done:
    don't send if you can't take it
    choosing the closest sender seems broken (e.g. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7138534)
    fleet netting
    split fleets up, don't just send all to one place
    don't just send to the closest, send to the best (scored)
    don't send too many, send just enough
    bug - dont send pop -1, send min (pop, future pop) -1
    favour protection over taking
