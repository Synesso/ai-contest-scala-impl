todo:
    do not send so much that the enemy could launch a successful attack next turn
    send more than worst state if the enemy state keeps regenerating (ie fleet is further away than worst state)
    simple tie-breaking on best candidate (by planet index)
    favour targets for which you have already committed lots (best target changes as map does)
    [maybe] all left over surplus should head towards target # 1.

done:
    01. don't send if you can't take it
    02. choosing the closest sender seems broken (e.g. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7138534)
    03. fleet netting
    04. split fleets up, don't just send all to one place
    05. don't just send to the closest, send to the best (scored)
    06. don't send too many, send just enough
    07. bug - dont send pop -1, send min (pop, future pop) -1
    08. favour protection over taking
    09. only send to neutrals when enemy is attacking if you arrive after it hits zero
    10. don't blindly send to what you can capture (as per 01). Try building up forces a little.

will not do:
    if there are only zero regen planets left then consider them
