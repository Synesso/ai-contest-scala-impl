todo:
    don't get confused between sending to one or the other in a mirror scenario
    don't send if you can't take it
    fleet netting
    don't send if you can't arrive in time (?)
    favour targets for which you have already committed lots (best target changes as map does)

done:
    split fleets up, don't just send all to one place
    don't just send to the closest, send to the best (scored)
    don't send too many, send just enough
    bug - dont send pop -1, send min (pop, future pop) -1
    favour protection over taking
